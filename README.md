A Multisig HD Keoken Wallet Service.

# Description

Keoken Wallet Service facilitates multisig HD wallets creation and operation through a (hopefully) simple and intuitive REST API.

KWS can usually be installed within minutes and accommodates all the needed infrastructure for peers in a multisig wallet to communicate and operate â€“ with minimum server trust.
  
See [keoken-wallet-client](https://github.com/bitprim/keoken-wallet-client) for the *official* client library that communicates with KWS and validates its responses.

KWS is been used in production enviroments for [Keoken Wallet](https://keoken.io).

# Getting Started
```
 git clone https://github.com/bitprim/keoken-wallet-service.git
 cd keoken-wallet-service
 npm install
 npm start
```

This will launch the KWS service (with default settings) at `http://localhost:3232/bws/api`.

KWS needs mongoDB. You can configure the connection at `config.js`

KWS supports SSL and Clustering. For a detailed guide on installing KWS with extra features see [Installing KWS](https://github.com/bitprim/keoken-wallet-service/blob/master/installation.md). 

KWS uses by default a Request Rate Limitation for its CreateWallet endpoint. If you need to modify it, check defaults.js' `Defaults.RateLimit`

# Using KWS with PM2

KWS can be used with PM2 with the provided `app.js` script: 
 
```
  pm2 start app.js --name "keoken-wallet-service"
```

# Security Considerations
 * Private keys are never sent to KWS. Copayers store them locally.
 * Extended public keys are stored on KWS. This allows KWS to easily check wallet balance, send offline notifications to copayers, etc.
 * During wallet creation, the initial copayer creates a wallet secret that contains a private key. All copayers need to prove they have the secret by signing their information with this private key when joining the wallet. The secret should be shared using secured channels.
 * A copayer could join the wallet more than once, and there is no mechanism to prevent this.
 * All KWS responses are verified:
  * Addresses and change addresses are derived independently and locally by the copayers from their local data.
  * TX Proposals templates are signed by copayers and verified by others, so KWS cannot create or tamper with them.

# Using SSL

  You can add your certificates at config.js using:

``` json
   https: true,
   privateKeyFile: 'private.pem',
   certificateFile: 'cert.pem',
  ////// The following is only for certs which are not
  ////// trusted by nodejs 'https' by default
  ////// CAs like Verisign do not require this
  // CAinter1: '', // ex. 'COMODORSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt'
  // CAinter2: '', // ex. 'COMODORSAAddTrustCA.crt'
  // CAroot: '', // ex. 'AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt'
```

@dabura667 made a report about how to use letsencrypt with BWS, which applies to KWS: https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet-service/issues/423
  

# REST API

Note: all currency amounts are in units of satoshis (1/100,000,000 of a bitcoin).

## Authentication

  In order to access a wallet, clients are required to send the headers:
```
  x-identity
  x-signature
```
Identity is the Peer-ID, this will identify the peer and its wallet. Signature is the current request signature, using `requestSigningKey`, the `m/1/1` derivative of the Extended Private Key.

See [Keoken Wallet Client](https://github.com/bitprim/keoken-wallet-client/blob/master/lib/api.js#L73) for implementation details.

Returns:
 * List of Addresses object: (https://github.com/bitprim/keoken-wallet-service/blob/master/lib/model/address.js)).  This call is mainly provided so the client can check these addresses for incoming transactions (using a service like [Insight](https://insight.is)

`/v1/balance/`:  Get Wallet's balance

Returns:
 * totalAmount: Wallet's total balance
 * lockedAmount: Current balance of outstanding transaction proposals, that cannot be used on new transactions.
